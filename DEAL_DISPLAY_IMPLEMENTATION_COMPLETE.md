# Deal and Business Information Display - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary

The issue was that **all** deal details and business details from the database were not being properly displayed in the admin view section of deals due to **database column name mismatches**. 

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified

The database schema migration scripts had renamed columns in the `deal_redemptions` table from snake_case to camelCase:
- `deal_id` → `dealId`
- `user_id` → `userId` 
- `redeemed_at` → `redeemedAt`

However, the backend SQL queries were still using the old snake_case column names, causing SQL errors and preventing data from being fetched correctly.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend SQL Query Fixes
Fixed **all** SQL queries across multiple files to use the correct camelCase column names:

#### `backend/routes/admin.js` - Admin deal management endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/deals` - Fixed redemption count queries
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/deals/:id` - Fixed individual deal details  
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/deals/:id/redemptions` - Fixed redemption list
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/redemptions/:id/status` - Fixed redemption status updates

#### `backend/routes/merchant.js` - Merchant dashboard:
- ✅ Fixed deal analytics queries
- ✅ Fixed recent redemptions queries

#### `backend/routes/deals.js` - Deal redemption process:
- ✅ Fixed redemption checking logic
- ✅ Fixed redemption insertion
- ✅ Fixed monthly limit queries
- ✅ Fixed user redemption history

## 🗄️ Database Schema Compatibility

The fixes ensure compatibility with the updated database schema:

```sql
-- Correct column names now being used:
CREATE TABLE deal_redemptions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    dealId INT NOT NULL,           -- ✅ Now using camelCase
    userId INT NOT NULL,           -- ✅ Now using camelCase  
    redeemedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- ✅ Now using camelCase
    redemptionCode VARCHAR(50),
    status ENUM('redeemed', 'used', 'expired') DEFAULT 'redeemed'
);
```

## 🚀 Result
