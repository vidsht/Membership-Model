# ✅ DEAL UPDATE ERROR - RESOLVED

## Problem
Error occurred when updating deals: `Unknown column 'updated_at' in 'SET'`

The backend was trying to update a non-existent `updated_at` column in the `deals` table.

## Root Cause
The admin deal update query in `backend/routes/admin.js` (line 1883) included:
```sql
UPDATE deals 
SET title = ?, description = ?, businessId = ?, category = ?, 
    discount = ?, discountType = ?, originalPrice = ?, discountedPrice = ?, 
    termsConditions = ?, validFrom = ?, validUntil = ?, couponCode = ?,
    minPlanPriority = ?, accessLevel = ?, status = ?, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = ?
```

The `updated_at = NOW()` was causing the error because the column doesn't exist in the current database.

## Solution Applied
**File:** `backend/routes/admin.js` (line ~1883)
**Change:** Removed `updated_at = NOW()` from the UPDATE query

**Before:**
```sql
minPlanPriority = ?, accessLevel = ?, status = ?, updated_at = NOW()
```

**After:**
```sql  
minPlanPriority = ?, accessLevel = ?, status = ?
```

## Result
✅ Deal updates now work without throwing database column errors
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ System is more resilient to database schema variations

## Optional Enhancement
If timestamp tracking is needed in the future, the `updated_at` column can be added to the deals table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE deals 
ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

## Status: **RESOLVED** ✅
