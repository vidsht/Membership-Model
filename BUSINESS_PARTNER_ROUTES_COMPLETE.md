- **Component**: `PartnerRegistration.jsx` (Edit Mode)
- **Purpose**: Edit existing business partner details
- **Navigation**: From "Edit" button in business partners table
- **Features**: Pre-populated form with existing partner data

### 3. `/admin/partners/:id` → View Details Button

- **Features**: Comprehensive partner profile with edit/close actions

## Files Modified

### 1. Frontend App.jsx
```jsx
// Added imports
import PartnerRegistration from './components/admin/BusinessPartners/PartnerRegistration';
import PartnerDetail from './components/admin/BusinessPartners/PartnerDetail';

// Added routes
<Route path="/admin/partners/register" element={
  <AdminRoute><PartnerRegistration /></AdminRoute>
} />
<Route path="/admin/partners/:id/edit" element={
  <AdminRoute><PartnerRegistration /></AdminRoute>
} />
<Route path="/admin/partners/:id" element={
  <AdminRoute><PartnerDetail /></AdminRoute>
} />
```

### 2. MerchantManagementEnhanced.jsx
```jsx
// Updated navigation methods
const handleAddMerchant = () => {
  navigate('/admin/partners/register');
};

const handleEditMerchant = (merchant) => {
  navigate(`/admin/partners/${merchant.id}/edit`);
};

const handleViewDetails = (merchant) => {
  navigate(`/admin/partners/${merchant.id}`);
};
```

### 3. AdminDashboard.jsx
- Removed automatic redirect logic for `/admin/partners` routes
- Maintained tab-based navigation for main admin dashboard

## Backend Endpoints Confirmed Working

All required API endpoints are functional:
- `GET /api/admin/partners` - List all partners ✅
- `GET /api/admin/partners/:id` - Get partner details ✅  
- `POST /api/admin/partners` - Create new partner ✅
- `PUT /api/admin/partners/:id` - Update partner ✅
- `GET /api/plans?userType=merchant` - Get merchant plans ✅

## Button Functionality Mapping

| Button | Location | Action | Destination |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Add Partner** | Business Partners table header | Navigation | `/admin/partners/register` |
| **Edit** (📝) | Each partner row | Navigation | `/admin/partners/:id/edit` |  
| **View Details** (👁️) | Each partner row | Navigation | `/admin/partners/:id` |

## Component Features

### PartnerRegistration.jsx
- **Add Mode**: Empty form for new partner registration
- **Edit Mode**: Pre-populated form when `partnerId` is in URL params
- **3-Step Form**: Basic Info → Business Details → Review & Submit
- **Validation**: Comprehensive form validation with error handling
- **Plan Selection**: Dynamic loading of merchant plans from API

### PartnerDetail.jsx
- **Route-based**: Loads partner data using `partnerId` from URL params
- **Modal/Page Mode**: Works both as modal overlay and standalone page
- **Edit Button**: Direct navigation to edit mode
- **Comprehensive Data**: Shows all business and owner information

### MerchantManagementEnhanced.jsx
- **Navigation Integration**: All buttons now use proper route navigation
- **Maintained Features**: Custom deal limits, status management, filtering
- **Dual View**: Cards and table views both support route navigation

## Testing Results

✅ All frontend routes properly configured  
✅ All component imports successful  
✅ All navigation methods implemented  
✅ Backend API endpoints accessible  
✅ Edit mode functionality working  
✅ Route-based data loading working  

## User Experience

1. **Add Partner**: Click "Add Partner" → Redirects to registration form → Complete 3 steps → Success
2. **Edit Partner**: Click edit icon → Redirects to pre-filled form → Make changes → Save → Return to list
3. **View Details**: Click view icon → See full partner profile → Edit button available → Close to return

## Backward Compatibility

- `/admin/partners` still redirects to main admin dashboard Business Partners tab
- Existing functionality in MerchantManagementEnhanced preserved
- All custom deal limit features maintained
- Inline editing for deal limits still available via quick edit button

## Next Steps

The implementation is now complete and all requested routes are functional. Users can:
- Add new business partners via the dedicated registration route
- Edit existing partners with pre-populated forms  
- View detailed partner information in dedicated view pages
- Access all functionality through proper button navigation

The system maintains full backward compatibility while providing the requested route-based functionality.
