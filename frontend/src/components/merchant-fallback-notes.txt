Fallback logic added to MerchantCertificate.jsx:
- If /merchant/business-info returns 404, call public /businesses and try to match by user.email, user.fullName or user.businessId.
- Map public business fields to businessInfo shape used by certificate component.
- This mirrors membership card behavior which uses AuthContext user without session-dependent API.

Note: Public /businesses only returns approved businesses; pending merchants may still not be found.
If merchant is pending, they should complete profile or wait for approval.
