   - Created modern, responsive MerchantDashboard.css

### 🎯 REMAINING TASKS

#### High Priority (Server Errors)
1. **Deal Creation Debugging**
   - Investigate SQL insert error in deal creation route
   - Verify deals table schema matches insert query
   - Test deal creation endpoint thoroughly

2. **Admin Dashboard Debugging**
   - Debug stats calculation query in admin dashboard
   - Check if all referenced tables exist and have correct structure
   - Fix any column name mismatches in admin queries

#### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add better error logging and debugging info
   - Implement comprehensive error responses
   - Add proper validation error messages

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test all CRUD operations for deals
   - Test admin user management features
   - Validate all form inputs and edge cases

#### Low Priority (Polish)
5. **Code Cleanup**
   - Remove any remaining debug code
   - Update documentation
   - Optimize database queries

### 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READINESS

- **Backend Server**: ✅ Running on localhost:5000
- **Frontend Server**: ✅ Running on localhost:3002
- **Database**: ✅ MySQL connection stable
- **Authentication**: ✅ Session-based auth working
- **User Flows**: ✅ Registration and login working
- **Merchant Flows**: ✅ Most functionality working
- **Admin Flows**: 🚧 Login working, dashboard needs debugging

### 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. Debug the deal creation server error by examining the deals table structure vs the insert query
2. Debug the admin dashboard server error by checking the stats calculation queries
3. Test deal redemption functionality once deal creation is fixed
4. Perform comprehensive testing of all user/merchant/admin workflows
5. Deploy to production environment once all server errors are resolved

The application is now in a much more stable state with the core authentication and merchant dashboard functionality working correctly. The main issues are server-side errors in deal creation and admin dashboard that need debugging to complete the implementation.
